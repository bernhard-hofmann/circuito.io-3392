# circuito.io-3392

This is the code for the Circuito.io forum question 3392: https://talk.circuito.io/t/a-programming-challenge-involving-piezo-sensors-leds-and-relays/3392.

## Original requirements description:

Build a pair of nerf quickdraw targets.

"I want to be able to press a button and then have the Arduino wait a random 2- 5 seconds then turn a 12v LED on each target on using a relay. The lit LED means that each player may draw their blaster and shoot the target. once this happens I want to have a piezo sensor on each target to sense how fast each person was and then have the faster person’s target turn solid while the other person’s turns off. And to make it a little more competitive I would also like to add an LCD to display the time of each player."
